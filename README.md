My first idea was it to build my own Cloud with OwnCloud!
Then after much Problems it works.

I decided to create and "develope" an Apache2 Webserver with a lot of Sites.

When i hadn't anymore ideas, installed Pi-Hole to block all Ads!
This was very fast done.
So i had nothing to do, again...

Then I bought wireless sockets. I would controlled them with my Pi.
I used Raspberry-Remote and WiringPi.
I personalized the Web Interface and saved it with a password.


This ReadMe isn't ready.
It's going on....
